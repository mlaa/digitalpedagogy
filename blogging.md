## CURATORIAL STATEMENT


Blogging offers instructors rich, dynamic environments that challenge students to focus on process and audience, and to disrupt patterns and habits developed when writing more traditional essay forms. In first-year composition courses instructors can use blogging assignments to introduce students to critical thinking, argument, and analysis. In more advanced literary and cultural studies courses, blogs help students to engage with complex subject matter, enhancing reflection through collaborative writing. In communications and professional writing courses, students experiment with different rhetorical approaches, voice, and consider degrees of public and private discourse. The most robust of these assignments are scaffolded across the semester, reinforcing course objectives and establishing new learning paradigms; the drafting process changes and emphasis shifts from revise-and-submit to cumulative improvement, with more moments for instructors to point out to students when and how they improve.

Blogging assignments are challenging for instructors because they require more attention to design, implementation, and evaluation than traditional essay formats. Instructors must be specific about what is expected: definition of success must be clearly articulated, integration of an often unfamiliar format must be explained, and students' discomfort with writing in this mode must be managed. Students may have trouble adjusting to a content management system dashboard environment; therefore, the instructor may incorporate preparatory exercises that help students to master the mechanics of blog writing before the first formal post is assigned, thus ensuring that students can succeed in unfamiliar writing environments. Emphasis on prompt clarity is also important. A prompt may be intentionally vague or prescriptive: vagary can be helpful when the goal is for students to experiment with voice and form; specificity is valuable when an assignment calls for students to conform to a particular style.  

Straightforward blog assignments may suggest easily implemented substitutes for short print-and-submit essays, and some instructors experiment with low-risk blog assignments to gain confidence. But as instructors gain confidence they should try more creative approaches. Assignments that encourage students to think about voice can become assignments in which students create personae and write as characters; assignments in which students focus on design can be expanded to those in which students build their own sites. Boone Gorges and Ryan Cordell have employed this model, and illustrate ways to effectively pull individual student blogs into one central "hub" space to effect community. Gorges participates as a blog contributor in the hub site, using his posts to call attention to and contextualize individual student posts. His posts thus serve as guides for further student consideration of their own and other students' posts.

The instructor must think carefully about the type and degree of feedback they are able to provide to students. In large composition courses, instructors must provide meaningful qualitative assessment; a process-based blog assignment constituting multiple posts and comments is a challenge. Streamlining the review process helps the instructor to avoid  grading backlog that ultimately undermines the idea of developmental writing across the semester. Katy Crowther found a creative solution to the grading problem by incorporating a student editor component into her assignment. Crowther's students took turns serving as guest-editors, reading all posts and publishing an overview that tied them all together (“Putting Students to Work”; “Punking the Victorians”). Her students gained agency as well as insight into the assessment process, and she was able to let go of some  qualitative feedback.

Blogging environments offer instructors ways to help student authors consider audience and degrees of privacy and publicity. Students begin to experiment with style when they realize that their classmates are also their readers. Because blogs are traditionally public-facing and openly readable, instructors can use blogging assignments to address the benefits and potential pitfalls of accessibility. While platforms such as WordPress offer authors flexibility in terms of audience, an instructor who is new to blogging may opt for more conservative, restricted readership, perhaps expanding audience as students gain confidence. Students should also have a voice in whether and how their work is published beyond the classroom. Anonymization may be an option, and is particularly valuable when concerns about identity are a factor. Jacqueline Wernimont has written about online acts of violence perpetrated against students and instructors, and how this is often directed at women (Wernimont 2016). Instructors must design assignments responsibly, especially when encouraging students to identify themselves in their posts. Instructors should also be aware of institutional policies and safeguards regarding the protection of students (and themselves) in online and social media environments, and understand what options are available if violence affects students. 

The artifacts presented here offer a breadth of approach by instructors who encourage experimentation to students as they write and read. While the examples are all from
humanities courses, the assignments are adaptable enough to be used more broadly in composition, literature, or media studies courses.



## CURATED ARTIFACTS:

### "Texts, Maps, Networks: Digital Literary
![screenshot](images/blogging-Cordell-assignment.png)

* Artifact Type: Assignment
* Source URL: http://f14tmn.ryancordell.org/assignments/class-blogging/
* Artifact Permissions: [to come]
* Copy of the Artifact: Course site hosted by the University on the Wordpress platform. As of 2/21/2016 student work is publicly viewable, although several of the student sites have been taken down and some links lead to 404 errors.
* Creator and Affiliation: Ryan Cordell, Northeastern University

This assignment is distinctive in that it is built upon
another, in which students are required to set up their own
website;(Cordell http://bit.ly/1n68PaP) Cordell then collects site
details and aggregates posts into the master course site. Students
are expected to write at the end of each course module, posting and
commenting upon classmates' posts at least three times. The title for
each post appears on the course site and links to the relevant post
on the student's site, which is also where comments are posted. The
rubric is general and evaluation is unclear, but Cordell indicates that
he will supply more detailed feedback upon student request. 
KDH: (same comment as previous) WHY IS THIS ASSIGNMENT ENGAGING FOR BLOGGING? WHAT DOES IT REPRESENT IN TERMS OF THE WAY YOU HAVE DEFINED BLOGGING ABOVE?

### "Blogging about Duffy's Manuscripts" 
![screenshot](images/blogging-Croxall-instructions.png)

* Artifact Type: Assignment
* Source URL: http://www.briancroxall.net/dh/assignments/blogging-about-duffys-manuscripts/
* Artifact Permissions: [to come]
* Copy of the Artifact: Blog hosted on Croxall's website on the Wordpress platform. As of 2/21/2016 student work is publicly viewable.
* Creator and Affiliation: Brian Croxall, Emory University

This artifact is one element of a larger blogging assignment. The
two assigned posts focus on reflection of work done with poem
manuscripts at Emory's rare books library (MARBL). Students choose
two poems by Carol Duffy, go to MARBL to find the physical manuscript
pages, and write about their experience working with manuscript
copies of the poem and printed versions they have read for class.
Students are free to write about anything that intrigues them.
Croxall invites them to write more than two posts and proposes two choices
for adjusting grading of the overall blogging assignment if a student does so. On the course website Croxall gives an explanation about why he assigns blogs (Croxall 2011), and emphasizes the conversational nature of blogging. This
straightforward assignment could be readily adapted for a literature
course with special emphasis on the relationship between manuscript
and print. 

### "Thinking Goodly: Introduction to Ethics" 
![screenshot](images/blogging-Gorges-site.png)

* Artifact Type: Course site with blog comments and links <—KDH: IS THIS AN EXAMPLE OF STUDENT WORK?
* Source URL: https://boonebgorges.wordpress.com/2008/11/20/in-the-blogs-11202008/
* Artifact Permission: [to come]
* Copy of the Artifact: Blog hosted by Gorges on a course-specific website on the Wordpress.com platform. As of 2/21/2016 only some student work is publicly viewable (several students have deleted their blogs).
* Creator and Affiliation: Boone Gorges, Hofstra University

While this assignment from 2009 is old by digital pedagogy standards,
Gorges's use of the hub-and-spoke blogging structure offers an
interesting approach to public writing. The mechanisms (prompt,
commentary, and links to student posts) are still available, inline
with other course assignments on the course site. Post and comment
submission deadlines are staggered, giving students time to comment
upon one another's work. Gorges reads a selection of posts twice
weekly, and aggregates several posts into the course site (the twice
weekly "In the blogs" posts), which he notes results in better
reading and commenting on specific posts. It is unclear whether
Gorges manages grading this way, or just models good posting. This is an ambitious assignment, and Gorges acknowledges
that it is not for the faint of heart (Gorges 2009). 

### "Digging into the Digital" 
![screenshot](images/blogging-Jakacki1-description.png)

* Artifact Type: Assignment and rubric
* Source URL: http://diggingdigital.blogs.bucknell.edu/reflection-posts/
* Artifact Permission: given by author (will either get all student permission or lock off access to student work)
* Copy of the Artifact: Blog hosted by the University in the Wordpress platform. As of 2/21/2016 student work is publicly viewable.
* Creator and Affiliation: Diane Jakacki, Bucknell University

This semester-long assignment (five posts) is a
reflection/project presentation exercise, reinforcing the course
focus on digital humanities praxis using a set of archival materials. Students examine scholarly DH resources and read a selection of articles and essays about DH research and methodology, and then reflect upon that scholarly work in context with and embedded presentation of their own work that could not be accomplished through more traditional essay forms. Within their posts they also
embed, link to, or include screenshots of the artifacts they produce
for each module (story maps, timeline entries, data visualizations,
digital edition). The assignment reinforces the idea that student
work exists along a spectrum with work produced by established
scholars. They experiment with voice and visual rhetoric while they
discuss process and product. 

### Title of Artifact: "Shakespeare's (English) Histories”
![screenshot](images/blogging-Jakacki2-description.png)

* Artifact Type: Assignment and rubric
* Source URL: http://blogs.iac.gatech.edu/henriad/short-research-project/
* Artifact Permission: given (no access to student work)
* Copy of the Artifact: Course site hosted by the University in the Wordpress platform. As of 2/21/2016 the course site with assignment descriptions is publicly viewable; student work is private.
* Creator and Affiliation: Diane Jakacki, Georgia Institute of Technology

This is one of two blog assignments in the course and is related
to a research project. It involves two written augmentations to the
formal in-class presentation: 1) a published abstract for each
student project, including scholarly sources and media to be used in
presentation; 2) a platform for peer feedback. The draft abstract was
reviewed by Jakacki and Georgia Tech subject librarian Sherri Brown
for revision. At the end of each student's presentation all students
employed the comment feature on the presenter's abstract to give
immediate feedback. The abstract was marked in draft and revised
phases; all students received a completion mark for each comment, and
peer feedback was incorporated into the presenter's grade. This
assignment uses the blog to bridge the gap between in-class and
written work, and reinforces the importance of constructive peer
review.

### "Media, Materiality, and Archives" 
![screenshot](images/blogging-Klein-syllabus.png)

* Artifact Type: Syllabus
* http://blogs.iac.gatech.edu/archives16/syllabus/
* Artifact Permission: [to come]
* Copy of the Artifact: Course site hosted by the University in the Wordpress platform. As fo 2/21/2016 student work is visible. 
* Creator and Affiliation: Lauren Klein, Georgia Institute of Technology

Klein's assignment demonstrates how blogs can form complex
collaborative writing environments, with different writing tasks
assigned over what she calls "cycles". 

Students are broken into four groups; each group has a different
task each week of a cycle: they serve as First Readers, Respondents,
or Searchers (the fourth group gets a week off). Klein outlines what
these tasks consist of, and how each student's work will be assessed
per cycle (there are two cycles of 12 possible points each). In
reading student work, it appears that blog writing is rooted in
weekly readings(11), however the prompts are available only via
Georgia Tech's LMS and so not available for review. This is a complex
assignment, one better suited for an instructor who has experience
assigning collaborative online writing. Commitment to explaining
different tasks would be crucial for student success for an
assignment worth 24% of the course grade.

### "Selfies, Snapchat, & Cyberbullies: Coming of Age Online" 
![screenshot](images/blogging-Posner-overview.png)

* Artifact Type: Assignment
* Source URL: http://miriamposner.com/dh150w15/assignments/weekly-blog-posts/
* Artifact Permission: [to come]
* Copy of Artifact: Blog hosted on Posner's website on the Wordpress platform. As of 2/21/2016 student work is publicly viewable.
* Creator and Affiliation: Miriam Posner, UCLA

In this clear, straightforward weekly assignment students submit
a 300-400 word blog post that brings course readings in line with
media that students encounter in daily life. Posts are submitted
early in the week in advance of class; Posner instructs students to
include some form of media or link that refers to the media item the
writer describes, with an explanation of how their experience with
the thing relates to the reading. Students post two substantial
comments on classmates' work. The rubric is simple but evaluation is
intentionally vague: Posner explains what she expects with a link to
examples of other students' posts from a previous course. The
assignment is tied to her Contract Grading system. Posts apparently
are marked as complete. This assignment would be easy to adapt to
many courses, and the focus on student self-evaluation addresses
concerns about granular feedback of many blog assignments.

### "History & Future of the Book" 
![screenshot](images/blogging-Sample-guidelines.png)

* Artifact Type: Assignment
* Source URL: http://sites.davidson.edu/dig350/guidelines/
* Artifact Permission: [to come]
* Copy of Artifact: Blog hosted on University website on the Wordpress platform. As of 2/21/2016 student work is publicly viewable.
* Creator and Affiliation: Mark Sample, Davidson College

This is a straightforward blogging assignment, with ten 400-500
word posts over the semester. Prompts are simple and rooted in each
week's reading. Posts are graded on a four point scale. Sample has
developed this rubric over time; his approach to evaluation involves
walking the class through examples of exceptional student work,
giving periodic feedback via comments, and assigning a
self-evaluation via "meta" post halfway through the term.

This type of assignment is easily adaptable to various course
environments. The rubric and grading methodology is also one that an
instructor new to blogging could adopt with confidence. One thing to
consider about any blog, and to which Sample alludes, is that this
type of assignment involves a significant amount of writing: ten
posts are worth 20% of the grade: approximately 5,000 words over the
course of the semester equals a 10-12 page essay. 

### "Tools, Techniques & Culture" 
![screenshot](images/blogging-Sayers-description.png)

* Artifact type: Assignment
* Source URL: http://jenteryteaches.com/2011/150/assignments/
* Artifact Permission: [to come]
* Copy of Artifact: Blog hosted by Sayers on a Wordpress platform (unclear if this is hosted on the university's server). As of 2/21/2016 student work is password-protected.
* Creator and Affiliation: Jentery Sayers, University of Victoria

This assignment is included specifically because it keeps student
work public and does not offer prompts. The assignment as outlined on
the course site is clearly explained as belonging to the class and in
many ways offline (prompts are circulated in class but not posted on
the site, for example). Sayers explains that students will post and
comment in group or clusters, so a very organic form of collaborative
writing evolves over the semester. Post expectations are open-ended -
Sayers emphasizes that there are different approaches to blogging,
and that posts can be reflections upon reading or discussion and
should make the writer in some way uncomfortable.

Entries and commentaries comprise a significant (30%) portion of
the student grade, with three grades given over the course of the
term: Sayers explains that each grade consists of a minimum of two
blog entries and a comment.

### Title of Artifact: "Virtually London: Literature and Laptops" 
![screenshot](images/blogging-Swafford-rubric.png)
 
* Artifact Type: Rubric
* Source URL: https://hawksites.newpaltz.edu/virtuallylondon/grading-rubric/
* Artifact Permission: [to come]
* Copy of Artifact: Blog hosted by the University in the Wordpress platform. As of 2/21/2016 student work is publicly viewable.
* Creator and Affiliation: Annie Swafford, SUNY New Paltz

There are two blogging assignments in this Literature course: one
scaffolded across the semester and one related to the final mapping
project. This annotation focuses on the scaffolded "Online
Assignments." The blogging assignments are analytical in nature, and
in aggregate constitute the largest component of the course grade
(36%, or 4 pts. each for nine posts). Swafford includes step-by-step tutorials designed to help students learn how to compose in a blog interface, to acclimate to the blogging style and expectations. Each subsequent prompt offers context and explicit instructions
about what the post should include.

The Blogging Rubric is clearly articulated: evaluation is on a
four-point scale. Students are expected to comment on one another's
posts, but commenting is not broken out in the rubric or given any
kind of separate completion mark.
