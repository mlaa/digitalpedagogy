#Welcome

The MLA’s second born-digital open-access anthology, Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments, is a collection of downloadable, reusable, and remixable pedagogical resources for humanities scholars interested in the intersections of digital technologies with teaching and learning. This collection documents the richly textured culture of teaching and learning that responds to new digital learning environments, research tools, and sociocultural contexts, mirroring the heterogeneous nature of digital pedagogy.

Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities is a book in a new form. It consists of approximately fifty keywords that connect humanities pedagogy with digital humanities methods, new media studies, computational research, networked environments, and digital culture. Each keyword has a “curator,” who briefly introduces a particular term in the context of teaching and learning and then provides ten pedagogical artifacts, such as syllabi, prompts, exercises, lesson plans, and student work drawn from actual courses, classrooms, and projects across the humanities. These artifacts are annotated, attributed with metadata, and accompanied by lists of related materials for further reading. After going through an open peer-review process, all keyword entries will be published under Creative Commons licenses to encourage circulation, editing, and repurposing by other practitioners.

[In blue box:] The anthology is now in open review. The editors invite you to acquaint yourself with the anthology and to participate in the open review process by commenting on the contents of the anthology to help the editors and contributors in their revisions. You may first wish to read the [description] (description.md) of the anthology and the [list of key words] (listOfKeywords.md). [End blue box.]
